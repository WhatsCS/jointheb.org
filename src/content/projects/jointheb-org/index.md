This site! Using a Gatsbyjs starter built off of bootstrap, with all needed SEO/image supports already included and configured. 

Originally, it was to be a rewrite of the current Portfolio project I have. As time went on though, it became clear that the better route to go would to be using some kind of "generator" for my website. For experience and due to lazyness, this app was born.
