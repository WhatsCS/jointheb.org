This is one of my earliest projects that was built for an ArmA 3 Mil. Sim. group that I helped run. This was used to generate an XML file for the game to read which allowed us to have patches and proper titles and ranks. While it is very basic, it fit our needs perfectly and was even adopted by another unit at the time!
