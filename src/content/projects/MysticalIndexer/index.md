A Django and Django Rest Framework file hosting API server. Supporting multiple styles of filename hashing and user account support. The goal was to allow for anyone to use their own custom front end if desired or use the MysticalUI project.

This project is one of many iterations of the same thing. There have been flask versions of the same server. Which I'm thinking about using once again as this repository is a total mess in my opinion.
